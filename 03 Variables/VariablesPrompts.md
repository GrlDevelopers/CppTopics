#Creating Variables!
###Instructions
Create a file called [INSERTDATE] [Your name] Variables.cpp. (For example, if I made a file it would be called '20150913 Jas Variables.cpp') Within that file, code all of the following assignments and number each one with comments. Print everything on a different line unless stated otherwise.
Example:
```cpp
int main()
{
	// problem 1
    what;
    // problem 2
    dothething;
    ...
}
```
####Useful information for variables
######Data types
- `bool`: true or false
- `int`: whole numbers
- `double`: whole numbers *and* decimals
- `float`: numbers between (and including) 1 and -1.
- `string`: set of words
- `char`: a single character

1. Create **3** integers named `a`, `b`, and `c`. Set them to different values. Then print out their sum.
2. Create another integer named `d`. Make it equal to the product of a, b, and c. Then print out `d`.
*(Hint: to find the product, multiply all the variables together).*
3. Create variable called `average` and make it equal to the average of `b`, `c`, and `d`. *(Hint: the average is the sum of all numbers divided by the amount of numbers--use a double. Remember to use parentheses!)*
4. Create a string for your favorite artist and another string for your favorite song. Use the variables to print out "`My favorite song is [song] by [artist].`"
5. Ask the user for a number and divide it by 2. Print out the result. *(Hint: use a double.)*
6. Ask the user for their age. Print out their age in week. Use the following format: "`Your age is in years is [years age] and your age in weeks is [age weeks].`"
